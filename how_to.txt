--- To compile:

cd core
make         # for an optimized version, but with asserts and debug info
make r       # for a release version (optimized, no asserts, no debug info)
make d       # for a debug version (unoptimized, asserts, debug info)

Note: Although the sources of the used aiger library are provided,
they are not compiled automatically by the makefile. That's why 
a compiled module aiger.o is also included. It is a 64bit version of the library.

If you need to compile minireachIC3 for 32bit, either rename the provided file
aiger.o_32 to aiger.o and then run make, or persuade the makefile to compile aiger.o for you from the sources.

--- To run on hardware model checking problems in the aiger format:

./minireachIC3 bobsmminiuart.aig

--- To run on symbolic transition systems in the DIMSPEC (http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~suda/DIMSPEC.html) format:

./minireachIC3 -format=dimspec freecell.spec

--- To view the available options:

./minireachIC3 --help

The relevant options are INPUT, PARSE, MAIN and STAT options.
The other categories are inherited from Minisat and their effect on minireachIC3 has not been tested.
